//! Grok Build's own program, as measured rather than as described.
//!
//! Generated from the `software_artifacts` block of
//! `references/grok-baseline.json`. Every member path below was read out
//! of the archive it names, not assumed: codex's carries the target triple and
//! so genuinely differs per platform.
//!
//! Where a `previous_software_artifacts` block is present, it is transcribed
//! too. It is not a second choice: the outgoing current pin is stored there on
//! a bump, so the pair is always two consecutive real releases and there is
//! still exactly one value to keep fresh.
//!
//! Do not edit. The test at the bottom re-reads that baseline and compares it
//! field by field, so an edit here fails rather than silently installing bytes
//! nobody measured.
